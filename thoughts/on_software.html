  <h1>Thoughts...On Software</h1>
  
  <p>Good software should be efficient and lightweight with the ability to extend or modify it on an as-needed basis. Modifications preferably should be done through a settings file or GUI. With proper abstraction, everything that can be a variable <em>should</em> be a variable modifiable by the user. Lazy software sets defaults and fails to include a way to modify them outside of changing source code.</p>
  <p>While not a requirement, I do prefer software that is Open Source and with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html" target="_blank">a copyleft licence</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Great software</strong> takes everything a step further. It has extensive documentation and users can immediately tell a lot of thought went into the design. It maintains a meaningful changelog, documentating all changes without including a "Fixed some minor bugs" cop out. An example of great software is <a href="https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.19" target="_blank">Beets</a>.</p>
  <p>ps. I am currently looking for Image Browsing Software for Windows that is (a) Open Source and (b) as efficient and as minimal as Impression:Eyes. I may take it as an opportunity to experiment with the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/" target="_blank">Rust programming language</a>.</p>
