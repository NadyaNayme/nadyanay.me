  <h1>Thoughts...On Social Justice</h1>
  <p>In short version: Good thing taken to an extreme by people as an excuse to be an asshole.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>The long version: The past decade has been a very interesting time. Or perhaps I was too naive to realize how people have perverted social justice for personal gain. The pitfall that traps everyone is the talking points. Don't be racist, pro-LGBT, helping out the less fortunate ("less privileged"), equality, etc.</p>
  <p>These are agreeable points for everyone who isn't a racist/sexist/bigot. Then you get to extremes like "microaggressions" or "manspreading" that make you wonder what it is you're really supporting. They start policing your speech, no master/slave drives, no more "his" or "her", no vulgarisms, all statements must be all-inclusive. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx4AlE3VNN0" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls" has been extended to "Men and women, transmen and transwomen, genderfluids and genderqueers, gender non-binaries and those still undecided. Otherkin and agekin, headmates, boys, girls, xoys, and xirls..."</a> and I probably left some out that hurt someone's feelings. Everyone knows feelings are all that matter anymore - facts are a conspiracy theory to marginalize and oppress people.</p>
<p>You're either in agreement with these people - or you're an asshole. <em>You don't want to be an asshole, do you?</em> That's the trap. They give you no room to disagree with even the smallest parts of their world views. You're either 100% for their cause or you're an asshole not worth speaking to. It's a kool-aid that you have to keep sipping. SJW's turn on each other the moment one shows any signs of Wrongthink.</p>
<p>It's a cult. Through and through. They act like a cult, they chant like a cult, they treat one another like a cult. They have their ingroups and outgroups to such extremes that you're either part of the cult or you aren't. They constantly doublethink and doublespeak like a cult. They look for things to make into problems, where no problem need exist.</p>
<p>If you think anything I say is "absurd" or "taking it too far" - you're either sipping the kool-aid yourself or you've been fortunate enough to not see the extreme positions these people take and how much support they gather from within their ingroups. Normal, less-involved people support these groups because of the above-mentioned pitfall: they don't want to be thought of as assholes. So without being well-informed on how the SJW bullies are acting, they support them.</p>
<p>You don't have to look hard to see the disgusting behavior or the support of it:</p>
