  <h1>Thoughts...On People</h1>
  <blockquote>"A person is great. People are terrible."</blockquote>
  <small>Yes I know that isn't how the quote goes.</small>

  <p>People lie too much. Nobody likes honesty because honesty is brutal and uncaring. Go ahead, try it. Be completely honest with someone about absolutely everything. They will hate you. Or maybe I'm just an asshole.</p>
  <p>People care about themselves too much. Most people will do anything they can to give themselves a slight advantage over others. Tragedy of the commons to the fullest extent.</p>
