# Nadyanay.me

Personal website with all public facing files being generated to a static website and minimized through a small toolchain.

## To Do

-   Redesigning site slightly
-   ~~Adding a blog/place for thoughts~~ Added using [Wintermsith][1] to generate the blog before running it through my build scripts for minification.
-   Updating Music and Anime recommendations
-   ~~Figure out how to do SRI via NPM Scripts now that I've replaced the old Gulp setup since everything broke over the past few years.~~ Is Gulp seriously the only easy way to automatically add SRI to HTML files in 2021? I'd still like to remove the dependency in the buildchain but it'll do for now.

## Privacy

All images open in a new tab and all external links open in a new tab by default and are told not to send a referrer in the header. I do not use an anonymizing service so that you will know exactly where the link will take you to. I don't load any 3rd party Javascript. I will never add user tracking of any type because I simply do not care. I don't care how popular the site is or isn't - it exists for my personal satisfaction.

If any external links are missing the rel="external noreferrer" let me know and I'll update it ASAP.
