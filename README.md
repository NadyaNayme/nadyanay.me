# Nadyanay.me

Personal website handwritten with public facing files being optimized using NPM Scripts.

## To Do

-   Redesigning site slightly
-   Adding a blog/place for thoughts
-   Updating Music and Anime recommendations
-   Figure out how to do SRI via NPM Scripts now that I've replaced the old Gulp setup since everything broke over the past few years.

## Privacy

All images open in a new tab and all external links open in a new tab by default and are told not to send a referrer in the header. I do not use an anonymizing service so that you will know exactly where the link will take you to. I don't load any 3rd party Javascript and currently don't even run any Javascript at all. I will never add user tracking of any type because I simply do not care. I don't care how popular the site is or isn't - it exists for my personal satisfaction.

If any external links are missing the rel="external noreferrer" let me know and I'll update it ASAP.
