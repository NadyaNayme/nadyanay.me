# Nadyanay.me

Personal website with all public facing files being generated to a static website and minimized through a small toolchain.

## To Do

-  Write my own static-site generator so I can finally abandon NPM, Gulp, and Wintersmith and my super janky build process.


## Building

This is primarily for future me. Read packaage.json and cry.

## Privacy

All images open in a new tab and all external links open in a new tab by default and are told not to send a referrer in the header. I do not use an anonymizing service so that you will know exactly where the link will take you to. I don't load any 3rd party Javascript. I will never add user tracking of any type because I simply do not care. I don't care how popular the site is or isn't - it exists for my personal satisfaction.

If any external links are missing the rel="external noreferrer" let me know and I'll update it ASAP.
