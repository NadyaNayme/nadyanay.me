  <h1>Thoughts...On Learning</h1>
  <p>I love to learn about things. Anything and everything, even if only surface deep. I don't care how pointless the fact or how useless a talent is - I want to learn about it.</p>
  <p>This gives me a great advantage in conversations. I can allow people to teach me about something they are passionate for. I don't get to do much talking, but I do get to do a lot of learning so that keeps me happy.</p>
  <p>I enjoy teaching as much as I do learning - unfortunately I find the things I want to teach people bore them to death.</p>
