I've recently decided to update my personal website after it has sat without change for nearly three years. In the process I've discovered that if you are not constantly on top of keeping the underlying technologies up-to-date that you are almost better off burning everything to the ground and starting from scratch.

<span class="more"></span>

After over 460 days of not being used - I’ve finally busted out the old X60 Thinkpad again and got it up and running again. The goal of the laptop was a safe place to learn Linux. I never exactly got around to doing that and the laptop has gathered dust for closer to 2-3 years with only the occasional dusting off and <code>sudo pacman -Syu</code> being ran. The laptop has once again been dusted off and to encourage myself to actually go through with learning Linux this time I decided to get my website build system up and running on the laptop. <span class="more"></span> This should allow me to write blogs from the laptop and have the build go directly to webdav. Until I’m certain I’ve set things up right I’m going to rely on <code>mv</code> but the goal is to eventually be in a place where I can <code>touch</code> a new blog post and publish it<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>easily.

I don’t have much to say here other than “I’ll finally be blogging like I planned<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>to”.

Assuming building this blog works out - I expect to start immediately on something I’ve wanted to blog about for a while. Which is what the retro/small web means to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>me.
