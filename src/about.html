			<h1>About Nadya</h1>
		</header>
		<p>I am a 90s kid at heart that firmly believes that sharing personally identifying information should be avoided. It is bizarre to me that in the early 2010s it suddenly became completely normal to share everything about yourself on The Internet. While I think having a consistent identity has its benefits - an identity does not require a real name or "person" to be behind it. This keeps "The Internet" and "Real Life" separate which I think is a healthy thing to do. I am a relatively private person. My favorite color is <span style="color:#CEFC92;">#cefc92</span>.</p>
		<p>I've been programming for nearly two decades. If you've seen my code - go ahead and laugh now. My code makes it look more like I've been coding two weeks at most. I pay nearly $75 a year for a vanity URL for my file uploads at <a
				href="https://kimiga.aishitei.ru"
				target="_blank"
				rel="external noreferrer"
				>kimiga.aishitei.ru</a> and I use Neocities to host this personal website which I have historically updated very sparingly.</p>
		<h2>Why "Nadya Nayme"?</h2>
		<p>Nadya Nayme is an anonymous psuedonym that is meant to sound like "Not a Name". It became my primary nickname after Chris Coyier asked me to stop using the name "Anonymous" when commenting on <a
				href="https://css-tricks.com"
				target="_blank"
				rel="external noreferrer"
				>CSS Tricks</a>. I respected his request but wanted to keep the idea of remaining "Anonymous". As a result - "Nadya Nayme" was born.</p>
				<p>Much of my early era online presence was within the Runescape community where I am known as "Nyu". Being a 3-letter username, "Nyu" is very difficult to use consistently across the internet and so I always used other psuedonyms. All of which have been lost to time; mostly on purpose.</p>
		<h2>Other Identities</h2>
		<p>If you wish to contact me - you should email me @aishitei.ru - any mailbox will work. Failing that you can find an incomplete list of my identities <a
			href="/identities.html"
			title="List of accounts I own if you wish to contact me or add me"
			>on my identities page.</a
		></p>
		<h2>Recommendations</h2>
		<p>I don't bother to keep these as up-to-date as I should. I don't watch anime nearly as much as I did a decade ago and it's easier to recommend music with YouTube playlists.</p>
